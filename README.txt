JQUERY 2 NOTICES
Multishop requires jQuery 2. Currently rzcolorbox and t3jquery have some issues. To bypass this problem we have shared some patched versions on Bitbucket.

Steps to do:
mkdir /sources

git clone https://basvanbeek@bitbucket.org/bvbmedia/rzcolorbox_jquery2.git

ln -s /sources/rzcolorbox_jquery2 /var/www/yourdomain.nl/web/typo3conf/ext/rzcolorbox
